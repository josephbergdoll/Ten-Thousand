  <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p>Ten Thousand Inc ("tenthousand.com") advises you to review the following basic rules that govern the use of our Site (the "Agreement"). Please note that your use of our Site constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by this Agreement.</p>

<h4>INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS</h4>

<p class="secondary">
We are unable to ship domestically and / or internationally to P.O./APO/FPO boxes.</p>

<h4 class="sub">DUTY, VAT AND OTHER FEES</h4>
<p class="secondary">Duty (or customs tariffs) is set by the destination country customs authorities and is determined based on a combination of the country of origin or manufacturing of the goods being purchased and the classification of that merchandise in accordance with a harmonized system adopted and used by the countries that our e-commerce partner, PayPal, supports. Check your local customs authority website for the latest updates on Value Added Tax (VAT) rates, customs tariffs and other fees. Ten Thousand Inc. holds no responsibility for fees that are subjected by international authorities.</p>

<h4 class="sub">RISK OF LOSS</h4>
<p class="secondary">All products purchased from the website are transported and delivered to you by an independent carrier not affiliated with, or controlled by, Ten Thousand Inc. Title to the products purchased on the website, as well as the risk of loss for such products, passes to you when Ten Thousand Inc delivers these items to the carrier.</p>

<h4>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h4>

<p class="secondary">All materials, including images, illustrations, designs, icons, photographs, and written and other materials that are part of this Site (collectively, the “Contents”) are copyrights, trademarks, trade dress and/or other intellectual property owned, controlled or licensed by Tenthousand.com, or, as otherwise noted, are the intellectual property of Tenthousand.com’s vendors and or suppliers. The Site as a whole is protected by copyright and trade dress, all worldwide rights, titles and interests in and to which are owned by Tenthousand.com. The Tenthousand.com mark and other marks appearing at this Site are the trademarks of Tenthousand.com, its vendors and or suppliers.</p>

<h4>USE OF CONTENT</h4>

<p class="secondary">This Site and all its Contents are intended solely for personal use. You may download or copy the Contents and other downloadable materials displayed on the Site for your personal use only. No right, title or interest in any downloaded materials or software is transferred to you as a result of any such downloading or copying. Except as noted above, you may not reproduce, publish, transmit, distribute, display, modify, create derivative works from, sell or participate in any sale of or exploit in any way, in whole or in part, any of the Contents or the Site.</p>

<h4>PRODUCT INFORMATION</h4>

<p class="secondary">Occasionally there may be information on our Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order).</p>

<p class="secondary">We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear at the Site. However, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate.</p>

<h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>

<p class="secondary">Saturdays.com provides the materials on this site “as is” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including without limitation, warranties of title, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement of intellectual property. TenThousand.com may modify the Content at any time without notice to you. We are not responsible for any damage to your computer, software, modem, telephone or other property resulting from your use of our Site. You further acknowledge that Tenthousand.com shall not be liable for any damages or any kind related to your use of this site.</p>

<h4>WEBSITE SECURITY</h4>

<p class="secondary">Ten Thousand Inc protects the privacy and confidentiality of member information by encrypting all data that is entered into the online forms.</p>

<p class="secondary">This is accomplished by using the industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer), and setting up a protected area (secure.waepa.org) on the Ten Thousand Inc website.</p>

<p class="secondary">It's easy to tell when the web site you are viewing is using an encrypted connection. If the connection is encrypted, the lock icon in the lower-right corner of the Browser/Navigator window is locked. If the connection is not encrypted, the lock icon is unlocked. You can also look at the browser URL Address line and check that the URL starts with https: (as opposed to the normal http: (note the "s" at the end indicating "Secure"), for example https://secure.waepa.org vs. http://www.waepa.org)</p>

<p class="secondary">Because the Ten Thousand Inc forms are in an area with a higher level of protection (and using encryption), web browsers may (depending on their security settings), display various warning and security messages. It is normally advised to click OK or Yes when you see these messages on the Ten Thousand Inc site. If you have additional questions or concerns please contact Ten Thousand Inc.</p>

<h4>MISCELLANEOUS</h4>

<p class="secondary">Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal by a court, such provision shall be valid and enforceable to the extent permitted by law or the applicable rules or bylaws, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions shall not be affected thereby. Failure of Tenthousand.com to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such provision.</p>

<p class="secondary">This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to any conflict of law provisions. In any action arising under this Agreement, you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and/or federal courts of the State of New York, County of Manhattan and/or the New York City.</p></article>
